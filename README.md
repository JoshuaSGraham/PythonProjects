# PythonProjects
A collection of smaller python projects and scripts that I have written.

## Matching brackets
Matching brackets is a small program that I made that takes a user inputted string and checks if the brackets are equal on both sides using a stack data structure.

## Usage:

### Windows
```
py.exe main.py <string>
```

### Linux
```
python3 main.py <string>
```
